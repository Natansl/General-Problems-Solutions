# General-Problems-Solutions

ðŸš§ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§ðŸš§

This repository contains implementations of algorithms designed to solve numerous problems.  Still in construction (collaboration is more than wellcome), the idea is to create a public repository for common problems studied in computer science.
So far, a few problems of graph theory have been addressed, but the idea in the long term is to extend the code to several other problems that tend to appear in computing.
